# game-of-life-jest-tests
Directly from https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps, I've tried to keep developing the game of life in javascript with TDD

## Jest unit tests

This folder contains a unit test template for [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest).

Configured to support ES6 syntax using Babel (preset `es2015`)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

```bash
npm test
```

Or you can use built-in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Show coverage

```bash
npm run test:cover
```

Note: coverage is also included in watch mode.
